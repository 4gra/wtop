wtop for running statistics
---------------------------

wtop is like "top" for your web server. How many searches or sign-ups are
happening per second? What is the response time histogram for your static
files? wtop shows you at a glance.


logrep for webserver log analysis
---------------------------------

wtop also comes with logrep, a powerful command-line program for ad-hoc
analysis and filtering. Spot-check page performance, errors, aggregate
statistics, etc.
