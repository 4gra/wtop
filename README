wtop is like "top" for your webserver. How many searches or signups 
are happening per second? What is the response time histogram for 
your static files? wtop shows you at a glance.

wtop also comes with:

* logrep, a powerful command-line program for ad-hoc analysis and filtering 

* logrep.py, a Python module you can use to write your own analysis programs
